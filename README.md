# Hi, I'm Aditya Sutar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-cycle product builder and founder of [Brewnbeer](https://brewnbeer.com), where I help startups go from idea to launch â€” fast and thoughtfully.  
I specialize in Flutter, Firebase, and Next.js, building everything from AI-powered tools to CRMs, internal platforms, and developer-first products.  
Iâ€™m also building [Flutter Jobs](https://flutterjobs.info) â€” a curated platform connecting Flutter developers with global opportunities.
